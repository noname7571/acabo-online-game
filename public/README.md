# Cabo Online Game Frontend

This is the frontend for the Cabo card game. Open `public/index.html` in your browser after starting the backend.

- `js/ws.js`: WebSocket connection logic
- `js/lobby.js`: Lobby UI logic
- `js/game.js`: Game UI logic (to be implemented)
- `css/style.css`: Styles

## Next Steps
- Implement lobby and game UI updates in JS
- Connect to backend WebSocket
- Add card images and game logic
